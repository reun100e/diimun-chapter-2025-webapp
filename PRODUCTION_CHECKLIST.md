- [x] Chunk size warnings adjusted
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create production build

### 3. Code Quality
- [x] Build completed successfully (0 errors)
- [ ] Linting warnings reviewed (94 warnings - mostly unused imports, non-critical)
- [ ] All images optimized (WebP format used)
- [ ] Meta tags and SEO configured

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test registration form with Supabase connection
- [ ] Verify all navigation links work
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Check all images load correctly
- [ ] Test payment screenshot upload functionality

### 5. Security
- [x] .env file added to .gitignore
- [x] Source maps disabled in production
- [ ] Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies configured
- [ ] API keys properly secured

### 6. Performance
- [x] Code splitting implemented
- [x] Images converted to WebP format
- [x] Lazy loading configured for routes
- [ ] Test Lighthouse score (aim for >90)

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Build artifacts in `dist/` folder verified
- [ ] All static assets (images, icons) copied to dist
- [ ] index.html properly generated
- [ ] Upload `dist/` folder to hosting platform
- [ ] Configure hosting platform environment variables

## 🚀 Deployment Platforms

### Vercel
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```
Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard under Site settings > Environment variables

### Other Platforms
Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server or CDN.

## 📊 Current Build Status

- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful
- **Build Size**: ~511 KB main bundle (optimized with code splitting)
- **Lint Status**: ✅ 0 errors, 94 warnings (non-critical)
- **Environment**: Production-ready configuration

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

### Verify Deployment
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test registration flow end-to-end
4. Verify email notifications (if configured)
5. Test on different devices and browsers

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Monitor Supabase usage and quotas
- Track user registrations
- Monitor page load times

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It's in .gitignore
2. **Database Setup** - Follow SUPABASE_SETUP.md for database configuration
3. **File Storage** - Ensure Supabase storage bucket is configured
4. **Linter Warnings** - 94 warnings are mostly unused imports, safe to ignore for now
5. **Bundle Size** - Main bundle is optimized with code splitting

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run `npm run build` with optimized config
2. Test the production build locally: `npm run preview`
3. Deploy to your hosting platform
4. Configure environment variables on hosting platform
5. Test live deployment thoroughly
6. Monitor for any errors or issues
