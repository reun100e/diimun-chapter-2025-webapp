# 📸 IPC Submission System - Complete Overview

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete, automated submission system for **International Press Corps** participants to submit:
- **Photography** (up to 2 photos with descriptions)
- **Essays/Journals** (PDF format, 500-700 words)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Submits → Frontend (React) → Supabase Storage → Edge Function → Google Sheets
```

### Files Flow:
1. User uploads files via beautiful web form
2. Files stored in Supabase Storage (secure, public URLs)
3. Webhook triggers Edge Function
4. Edge Function adds entry to appropriate Google Sheet
5. Evaluators view organized data in their sheet

**No Google Drive needed!** Files stay in Supabase, Sheets link to them.
